Write a function myPageRank.m to return the pagerank of a given connectivity matrix G and the probability of following a link in a page. The usage of the function is like this:

pageRank = myPageRank(G, p),

where G is the connectivity matrix and p is the probability of following a link in a page. Note that you can only use the power method to achieve this exercise. More specs are as follows:
    - Note that you can only use the power method to implement this function.
    - The initial guess of the page rank should be a probability vector of uniform distribution.
    - The maximum iteration count is 1000.
    - The iteration stops whenever max(abs(pr-prprev)) â‰¤ eps, where pr is the current page rank and prprev is the page rank obtained at previous iteration.
