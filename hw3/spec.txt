Chapter 9, Problem 9: Sorting vectors

For a given vector x, we can sort its element using the "sort" command:

    >> [x2, index] = sort(x);

The sorted vector x2 is actually equal to x(index). Write a function "sortInv" that returns x from given x2 and index, that is:

    x = sortInv(x2, index);

 To test your function, try the following script and the value of z should be 1:

     x = round(100 * rand(1, 100));
     [x2, index] = sort(x);
     x3 = sortInv(x2, index);
     z = isequal(x, x3)

(Hint: You can use "sort" command to create the function, which can be as short as two major lines of statements in the function body.)


Chapter 11, Problem 5: Reorganize a 3D array

A true-color image (such as a jpg file) of size m x n can be represented as a 3-dimensional array of size m x n x 3, where each layer (or page) is the pixel intensity of R(red), G(green), and B(blue), respectively.
